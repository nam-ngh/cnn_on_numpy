# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) modules from scratch

*Project Description:*
The main purpose of this project is to efficiently facilitate the construction and implementation of CNN architectures from scratch, without the use of existing deep learning libraries such as keras or pytorch. Using this library, you can endlessly experiment with building various neural network architectures for image classification, from a simple one-hidden-layer perceptron to a deep network of multiple Convolutional and Pooling layers, with the appropriate activation function and weights initialisation strategy - all while the code underneath is purely python and numpy.

*Project background:*
After building and training many CNN architectures using Keras's Sequential class, I wanted to deep dive into how neural networks actually work under the hood, and it turned out to be just a clever combination of linear algebra with differentiation and the chain rule. Therefore, it was possible to build my own model with nothing but numpy and python. However, my initial attempts, similar to most other implementations from scratch, took advantage of heavily nested for loops to carry out convolution, which is how convolution works in theory, but is borderline useless in practice since it is just way too slow. After some research, I discovered numpy's as_strided function and implemented this in place of all the for loops, which also allowed for vectorised matrix multiplication operations.
